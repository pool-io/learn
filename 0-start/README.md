# Getting Started

1. Create a folder to clone this repository into
    - The name of the folder may be anything but make sure its a folder you can easily access

    Ex.
        name: `pool-io`
        folder full path: `/Users/sbkim/Desktop/pool-io`

2. Run in Terminal: `git clone https://github.com/pool-io/learn.git`

3. Create a new branch: `git checkout -b <YOUR_NAME>`
    ```sh
        $ git checkout -b soungbae
    ```

4. Set Upstream & Push: `git push -u origin <YOUR_NAME>`
    ```sh
        $ git push -u origin soungbae
    ```

5. Make sure the push worked by going to GitHub
