# learn

This repository conains the background knowledge needed to be able to contribute to other repositories in this organization. It will start very basic but with the assumpion that this isn't your very first time writing code.

To be successful, you must follow these two rules:

1. Each topic will have a `README.md` which will contain words to read. **READ THEM**
2. Each topic will have an `excerise` folder which will contain exercises to do. **DO THEM**

Don't waste your time trying to memorize every word. You can always refer back to this or google it.
